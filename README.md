🖐️✨ Taught My Computer to Understand Hand Gestures – Now It Can Doodle Like a Toddler!

Just built a project where I used hand gesture detection to draw on a virtual canvas using only my fingers – no pen, no mouse… just ✨ vibes and OpenCV.

📽️ What It Does:

Tracks my hand in real-time (yes, even my awkward hand waves).

Detects gestures to switch between "drawing" and "not drawing" modes.

Paints on a canvas like MS Paint... if MS Paint had psychic powers and watched your fingers.

🧠 Why It's Awesome:

No touchscreen? No problem.

It’s like Pictionary meets AI — but with way more spaghetti-looking scribbles.

My system now understands finger pointing better than my dog. 🐶👆

🧰 Stack: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe (for hand tracking), and creative chaos.

Working on turning this into a full-blown gesture-controlled art tool — because clicking is so last season. 🎨💻
